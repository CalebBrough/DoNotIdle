    <h2>About the Game:</h2>
    <p>Do Not Idle is a game about raising awareness about idling to help change the climate so we can keep our planet clean.</p>

    <h2>Instructions/Movements:</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Use the left and right arrow keys to drive the car.</li>
      <li>Use the up arrow key to turn on the car, and the down arrow key to turn it off.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>At each level, you need to complete a task, but you need to make sure you don't idle when you stop moving! After that, just drive the rest of the way to go to the next level.</p>

    <h2>About Each Level and Why It's Included:</h2>
    <p>Level 1: This level is an example of a drive-thru at McDonalds (or any other fast-food restaurant), one of the places that most drivers idle without even thinking about it, and with a world-wide average wait time of about six minutes, there's lots of time to save some gas!</p>
    <p>Level 2 & 3: These levels are one of the most common places where drivers idle. These are an example of drop-off and pick-up situations, and because these areas contribute to a lot of the world's idling, it's always a smart idea to turn off your car and help save our planet.</p>
    <p>Level 4: During winter, people idle their cars in driveways (and, not as often, parking lots) to warm up their cars. In winter, because of inversion, this idling is really bad for the air and people's health, so why not save some money on your gas?</p>

    <p><b>Remember...  Save the gas - don't pass it!</b></p>
