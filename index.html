    <h2>About the Game:</h2>
    <p>Do Not Idle is a game about raising awareness about idling to help change the climate so we can keep our planet clean.</p>

    <h2>Instructions/Movements:</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Use the left and right arrow keys to drive the car.</li>
      <li>Use the up arrow key to turn on the car, and the down arrow key to turn it off.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>At each level, you need to complete a task, but you need to make sure you don't idle when you stop moving!</p>

    <h2>About Each Level and Why It's Included:</h2>
    <p>Level 1: This level is an example of a drive-thru at McDonalds (or any other fast-food restaurant), one of the places that most drivers idle without even thinking about it, and with a world-wide average wait time of about six minutes, there's lots of time to save some gas!</p>
    <p>Level 2: This level is another very common place where drivers idle. This level is an example of a drop-off situation, where there isn't a ton of idling, but there is still some gas to save by turning off your car.</p>
    <p>Level 3: Within the drop-off-pick-up group, pick-up areas are very prone to idling. When picking up a student from school, or any extra-curricular activity, it's always a smart idea to turn off your car and help save our planet.</p>

    <p>Remember... Save the gas--don't pass it!</p>
